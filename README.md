# Theseus-lib

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. What is Theseus?
Theseus-lib is an optimized library implementing the ideas from the Theseus algorithm []. Theseus, in its turn, is a fast, scalable and exact affine-gap sequence-to-graph aligner, based on the WaveFront Alignment algorithm (WFA) []. Notably, Theseus extends the ideas behind WFA's success to the sequence-to-graph framework. In this regard, it also behaves as an output-sensitive algorithm and, thus, its performance really shines when the aligned data shows high levels of similarity. Theseus has been designed as a general purpose aligner, with tow main functionalities:
1. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA): Theseus is capable of performing MSA based on the Partial Order Alignment (POA) approach. That is, the user can provide a set of sequences and Theseus will progressively build a POA graph representing the variation between them in a compact manner.
2. Mapping to a graph: Alternatively, Theseus can be provided with a graph, a sequence and a starting position and perform global alignment of the given sequence against the given graph, starting at the provided initial position.

### 1.2. What is WFA?
TODO: Copiado literalmente de la librería de Santiago. Lo tendría que cambiar o no cuenta como plagio jaja?
The wavefront alignment (WFA) algorithm is an exact gap-affine algorithm that takes advantage of homologous regions between the sequences to accelerate the alignment process. Unlike traditional dynamic programming algorithms that run in quadratic time complexity, the WFA runs in time O(ns+s^2), proportional to the sequence length n and the alignment score s, using O(s^2) memory (or O(s) using the ultralow/BiWFA mode). Moreover, the WFA algorithm exhibits simple computational patterns that the modern compilers can automatically vectorize for different architectures without adapting the code. To intuitively illustrate why the WFA algorithm is so interesting, look at the following figure. The left panel shows the cells computed by a classical dynamic programming based algorithm (like Smith-Waterman or Needleman Wunsch). In contrast, the right panel shows the cells computed by the WFA algorithm to obtain the same result (i.e., the optimal alignment)

### 1.3. Getting started
Git clone and compile the library, tools, and examples (by default, use `cmake` for the library and benchmark build).

```
git clone https://github.com/
cd theseus-lib
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```


## 2. Using Theseus

### 2.1. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) from scratch
The problem of MSA consists on comparing and aligning a given set of sequences. Given m sequences of length n, finding the optimal alignment of all sequences has an algorithmic cost of O(n^m). For this reason, practical implementations of MSA use several strategies to find good enough solutions to this problem. Lee [] proposed in 2003 the POA approach, which utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to represent the diverse alignments, compacting redundant information. Its proposal, extended the Smith-Waterman algorithm of sequence-to-sequence alignment to the context of DAGs, converting the MSA problem into a problem of progressively aligning more sequences to the graph reference. At each step, this approach essentially aligns a new sequence to the current DAG, which encapsulates the variation in the sequences processed so far. Theseus is able to perform such an MSA faster, taking advantage of the expected high similarity between the aligned sequences.

STEP 1: Creating the MSA aligner:
An aligner is the central object in the Theseus library and centralizes all the alignment calls. It is defined by a set of parameters and has to be created before performing any call: creating the aligner object is the first step if you want to use Theseus. For the use case of MSA, the aligner should be initialized with the following data:
1) A penalties object, containing the desired penalties for the aligner. This consists in defining the match, mismatch, gap open and gap extend cost.
2) An initial sequence to create the initial graph.

STEP 2: Adding a new sequence to the POA graph:
Once the aligner has been created, adding a new sequence to the POA graph is straightforward. You have to call the align() function of the aligner with the new sequence that you want to add. Let alg be your aligner and new_seq be the new sequence. Then you should do:
```
Alignment my_alignment = alg.align(new_seq);
```

Importantly, the aligner will return an Alignment object, with CIGAR, path and score, each time that we align a new sequence.

STEP 3.a: Store the results in fasta format:
Once you have aligned all the sequences, you can visualize the result in fasta format, converting the poa graph into a standard format. To do so, you have to invoke the output_msa_to_fasta() function of your aligner and provide an output file name:
```
alg.output_msa_as_fasta(output_file);
```

STEP 3.b: Store the results in GFA format:
```
alg.output_as_gfa(output_file);
```

TODO: Visualize in other format?

### 2.1. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) from a poa graph
An alternative is to continue an already existing MSA (how do we keep the weight information???)

- Thanks to Eizenga's formulation, Theseus-lib can operate with any match score. In practice, M=0 is often the most efficient choice.
