## <a name="introduction"></a> 1. Introduction

### <a name="what_is_theseus"></a> 1.1. What is Theseus?
Theseus is a fast, optimal and affine-gap Sequence-to-Graph aligner. It leverages the expected high similarity in the aligned data to accelerate computation and reduce the search space compared to other alternatives. Theseus is a general purpose aligner, providing two main functionalities:
1. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA): Theseus performs MSA of a set of N sequences using the Partial Order Alignment (POA) approach. That is, it progressively builds a partial order graph representing an MSA of a set of given sequences, adding one more sequence to the graph at each iteration.
2. Aligning to a graph: Alternatively, Theseus can align one or several sequences to a reference graph. The user has to provide an initial position for the alignment to start.

Theseus extends the proposal from the Wavefront Alignment algorithm (WFA), originally devised for pairwise sequence alignment, to the context of sequence-to-graph alignment.

### <a name="getting_started"></a> 1.2. Getting started
Git clone and compile the library, tools, and examples (by default, use `cmake` for the library and benchmark build).

```
git clone https://github.com/albertjimenezbl/theseus-lib
cd theseus-lib
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```


## <a name="using_theseus"></a> 2. Using Theseus

### <a name="msa_usage"></a> 2.1. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)

This example illustrates how to use Theseus as a Multiple Sequence Aligner. First, include the msa and general headers:
```
#include "theseus/alignment.h"
#include "theseus/penalties.h"
#include "theseus/theseus_msa_aligner.h"
```

Then, create and configure a MSA aligner object. This object is defined by two parameters: a set of penalties and an initial sequence behaving as the starting point of the alignment. An example on how to set such parameters and create an MSA object is found in the next code snippet:
```
theseus::Penalties penalties(match, mismatch, gap_open, gap_extend);
theseus::TheseusMSA aligner(penalties, initial_sequence);
```

Once this is done, we can start adding sequences to our POA graph using the align functionality, that returns an Alignment object with CIGAR, path and score information:
```
theseus::Alignment alignment_object = aligner.align(sequence);
```

Each time a new sequence is added to the POA graph, the graph is updated with the newly found variation (all the insertions, deletions and mismatches of the resulting alignment object).

Finally, we can output the result in three different formats: a graph in .gfa format, a multiple sequence alignment and a consensus sequence:
```
aligner.output_as_gfa(output_file);             // Output the compacted POA graph in .gfa format
aligner.output_as_msa(output_file);             // Output as a Multiple Sequence Alignment
sequence = aligner.get_consensus_sequence();    // Find the consensus sequence of the alignment
```


### <a name="alignment_usage"></a> 2.2. Aligning a sequence to a graph

This example illustrates how to use Theseus as a general Sequence-to-Graph Aligner. First, include the alignment and general headers:
```
#include "theseus/alignment.h"
#include "theseus/penalties.h"
#include "theseus/theseus_aligner.h"
```

Then, create and configure an aligner object. This object is defined by two parameters: a set of penalties and file stream containing a reference graph in .gfa format. An example on how to set such parameters and create an aligner is found in the next code snippet:
```
theseus::Penalties penalties(match, mismatch, gap_open, gap_extend);
theseus::TheseusAligner aligner(penalties, gfa_file_stream);
```

Once this is done, we can start aligning sequences to the reference graph using the align functionality. **Importantly**, a call to the align function consists of three arguments: the **sequence** to be aligned, the **starting vertex** for the alignment and **starting offset** in that starting vertex. The result of the alignment is an Alignment object with CIGAR, path and score information:
```
theseus::Alignment alignment_object = aligner.align(sequence, start_vertex, start_offset);
```


## <a name="theseus_tools"></a> 3.Tools

The Theseus library implements two minimal tools to use the Theseus algorithm on the MSA and Sequence-to-Graph alignment problems. It is important to note that these tools are not production ready.

### <a name="msa_tool"></a> 3.1. MSA tool: theseus_msa

This example illustrates how to use the **theseus_msa** tool. This tool computes the MSA of the set of sequences in an given input *.fasta* file. The executable is located in the path */build/tools/theseus_msa*:
```
cd build/tools/
```

Select the scoring scheme, set the input and output files and execute the tool. Each execution of *theseus_msa* lets you select the following parameters:
```
Options:
  -m, --match <int>           The match penalty                           [default=0]
  -x, --mismatch <int>        The mismatch penalty                        [default=2]
  -o, --gapo <int>            The gap open penalty                        [default=3]
  -e, --gape <int>            The gap extension penalty                   [default=1]
  -t, --output_type <int>     The output format of the multiple alignment [default=0=MSA]
      0: MSA: Standard Multiple Sequence Alignment format,
      1: GFA: Output the resulting POA graph in GFA format,
      2: Consensus: Output the consensus sequence,
      3: Dot: Output in .dot format for visualization purposes.
              Only tractable for small graphs
  -f, --output <file>         Output file                                 [Required]
  -s, --sequences <file>      Dataset file                                [Required]
```

An example of the execution of *theseus_msa* is shown in the following piece of code
```
./theseus_msa -m 0 -x 2 -o 3 -e 1 -t 0 -f output_file.out -s sequences.fasta
```


### <a name="seq_to_graph_tool"></a> 3.2. Seq-to-graph tool: theseus_aligner
This example illustrates how to use the **theseus_aligner** tool. This tool aligns a set of sequences, given their starting vertices and offsets, to a reference graph. Three input files are required: 1) The reference graph in *.gfa* format, 2) The sequences to be aligned in *.fasta* format, and 3) The set of starting vertices and offsets, in a file containing a line per starting position as *start_vertex start_offset*. The executable is located in the path */build/tools/theseus_aligner*:
```
cd build/tools/
```

Select the scoring scheme, set the input and output files and execute the tool. Each execution of *theseus_aligner* lets you select the following parameters:
```
Options:
  -m, --match <int>            The match penalty               [default=0]
  -x, --mismatch <int>         The mismatch penalty            [default=2]
  -o, --gapo <int>             The gap open penalty            [default=3]
  -e, --gape <int>             The gap extension penalty       [default=1]
  -g, --graph_file <file>      Graph file in .gfa format       [Required]
  -s, --sequences_file <file>  Sequences file in .fasta format [Required]
  -p, --positions_file <file>  Positions file                  [Required]
  -f, --output_file <file>     Output file                     [Required]
```

An example of the execution of *theseus_aligner* is shown in the following piece of code
```
./theseus_aligner -m 0 -x 2 -o 3 -e 1 -g reference_graph.gfa -s sequences.fasta -p positions.txt -f output.out
```
